This code is written in Java. To run this program, you must download a Java IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ). This is also written with maven testing, provided with a couple test cases.

Note: The AI_MinMax.java, MinMax.java, and Node.java files were originally authored by Mark Hallenbeck for CS 342 Fall 2020.
However, I have added some changes--the edits/addition of some functions.
